== Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection

Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a collection of malware signatures and IP reputation lists aggregated from commercial threat feeds, open source threat feeds, and Prisma Cloud Labs.
It is delivered to your installation via the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream.

The data in ATP is used by Prisma Cloud's runtime defense system to detect suspicious activities, such as a container communicating with a botnet herder or Tor entry node.
You can augment ATP by xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#import-malware-signatures[importing custom malware data] and xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#import-ip-reputation-lists[importing IP reputation lists].
ATP is the combination of both the Prisma Cloud-provided data set and your own custom data set.

The following hypothetical scenario illustrates how ATP protects your cloud workloads:

. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an app running in a container.

. The attacker attempts to download malware into a workload from a distribution point.

. Based on the ATP feed, Prisma Cloud runtime defense detects both the connection to the malware server and the write of the malicious file to the workload file system.

. Alerts/prevention is applied based on the runtime configuration.
